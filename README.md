# HolidayPlanner

## Description
The task was easy to understand and it was interesting to implement. There was quite much things to think before jumping to the implementation, specially 
all the validations of inputs and calculators.

## Challenges
When using Console Application as the main program, the validation of inputs took the most of the time. 
Another approach with GUI would propably made it a bit easier, but for this tas I think Console was enough.
